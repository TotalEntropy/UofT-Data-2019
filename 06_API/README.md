## Trends
* Temperature is highesr below the 20th latitude and drops sharply as you move farther north.
* Humidity and cloudiness does not have a strong correlation with latitude.
* The highest wind speeds seem to be farthest away from the equator which suggests that as you travel away from the equator wind speed increases. There isn't enough data to draw this concolusion more data would be required to verify this theory.
